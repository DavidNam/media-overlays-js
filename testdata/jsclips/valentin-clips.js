Written material produced by the investigated person himself or herself is, according to Engström, &quot;first-person documentation,&quot; while material about the person investigated is &quot;third-person documentation&quot;.

His biography first appeared in France in the 1950s in a Braille version and was later, on the decision of the World Blind Union, translated into English and published by the South African National Council for the Blind in 1987.

Skrébitsky can be said to have rediscovered Haüy in Russia during his own attempts to improve conditions for the blind. Haüy&apos;s institute for the blind in St Petersburg had by then been closed and forgotten for many years, but Skrébitsky found material in its archives on which he based his book. There was, for example, a box full of documents dating from the period 1807-1809, but only a few documents from the latter part of Haüy&apos;s stay in Russia. Skrébitsky managed to smuggle the box out of Russia and donated it to the Valentin Haüy Museum in Paris where it is still kept (Skrébitsky 1884).

His letter served several purposes. On the one hand, Diderot exposed a fraud which had taken place in the drawing-room of the scientist S.A. Réaumur , while on the other he made a number of observations which were a radical criticism of the conventional ideas of the time (Helldén 1994). The fraud in question consisted of a performance by a girl who claimed to be blind in Réaumur&apos;s drawing-room during which she played, sang and answered a series of general knowledge questions (for example, the length of certain rivers, the names of European cities, etc.). Diderot unmasked this humbug, but also pointed out that fraudulent performances were unnecessary, since the blind could in fact be educated. As an example of this, he mentioned the blind English mathematician Nicholas Saunderson. In the second half of his letter, Diderot has Saunderson express, in an imaginary dialogue, his own atheistic philosophy of life, for which Diderot paid with a brief sojourn in prison (Helldén 1994, Didier-Weygand 2000)."]

He earned a living as a translator of private and public documents and was soon able to boast the title of Royal Interpreter. He was also interpreter to the city council of Paris and the Admiralty. Before his appointment as royal interpreter he had become senior master in a secondary school. He later became a member of the Bureau Académique des écritures, founded by Louis XVI, probably because he had invented a method of deciphering secret codes and military code systems (Henri 1987). In 1771, the French police began to take an interest in deciphering codes, and during the following ten years, Valentin Haüy worked for the secret police, where his task was to investigate all foreign correspondence carried by the French postal service and to decipher secret documents. He continued these activities under the various revolutionary governments in the latter part of the century."]

In 1846, the Riksdag (Swedish parliament) decided that a new department for the blind should be established at Manilla. This regulation of education for the deaf and blind was a symptom, in Förhammars opinion, of the socializing ideas which had inspired the Elementary School Law of 1842. The blind were offered 13 free places (one from each diocese) at the Manilla institute. The curriculum was to include reading, writing, Luther&apos;s catechism and handicrafts.

Brorson, suggested the creation of a school for blind children. Frederick VI supported the project and personally contributed funds towards it. He himself inaugurated the institute and named it &quot;The Royal Institute for the Blind&quot;. Johansen could find no evidence to indicate that Fürst was a member of the Kjaeden Order, although he did find proof that he had approached Brorson after the creation of the institute for the blind and offered to teach there without compensation. The institute&apos;s curriculum included reading and writing and Fürst is said to have taught those subjects. Johansen, however, believes that education at the institute could not have been very successful, as Brorson was a decided opponent of the purchase of a printing press for the production of raised print books. The Danish Museum for the Blind, in spite of this opposition to the printing press, contains both a typographic case produced by Haüy and a copy of his famous essay. Were they perhaps Fürst&apos;s? Is the book one of the three copies Castberg bought in Paris? These questions remain unanswered. In the 1850s, management of the institute was taken over by the State. Nationalisation was preceded by a commission headed by Professor N.G. Melchior who had visited the institute in Paris in 1852 and seen for himself that blind pupils could learn to read with the help of raised print books. He later stated in his report that the Danish institute had not kept up with developments in this field (Johansen 1983). As a result of Melchior&apos;s report, the commission suggested that the institute should employ special teachers to teach the blind pupils to read and write. They should learn not only to write in ink in order to be able to communicate with the sighted, but also the Braille system so that they could communicate with one another. It was further suggested in the report that in their own interest blind children should be taught in their local school during their early years. They would then be admitted to the Institute for the Blind at the age of eleven."]

As he himself said, his encounter with the blind musicians at the St Ovid market was of decisive importance to his commitment to the blind. That incident may in fact be seen as an epiphany (moment of revelation), a turning-point in Haüy&apos;s life. Another such critical incident was his meeting with Lésueur.

The outstanding feature of Haüy&apos;s enterprise - which sets him apart from British pedagogues of the time - was the founding of a school in the true sense, which imparted free education to all blind children, regardless of sex or social class. A pupil did not have to be rich or highly intelligent to be admitted to his school. All previous attempts at educating the visually handicapped had been limited to children of well-to-do families and a few &quot;blind child prodigies&quot;. Haüy was also a pioneer of integration and equal opportunities. At the Paris institute, blind and sighted children were taught side by side. Haüy was convinced that his blind pupils, in time, would be capable of teaching the sighted. Furthermore, Haüy&apos;s methods involved co-education, which must be considered quite radical for the time. Haüy was, too, a pioneer of education for young children; he was teaching small children at the Musée des Aveugles long before Fröbel founded his school at Kilham in Germany in 1816. The idea of integration crops up repeatedly in his Essai sur l&apos;Education des Aveugles.

In Denmark, Brorson consciously opposed Haüy&apos;s ideas when he refused to introduce his methods of teaching the blind to read and write. In the wider perspective, however, it is clearly the case that Haüy&apos;s teaching methods formed the basis of the organised education of the blind which developed in the Nordic countries in the 1850s and 1860s.

It is highly probable that Haüy&apos;s difficulties in Russia were in fact caused by his lack of knowledge of Russian and by the fact that he was not familiar with the religion or culture of that country. One illustration of his lack of knowledge of Russian society is that he tried to teach blind students to play the organ while in St Petersburg, in his ignorance of the fact that organ music does not form part of the Greek Orthodox Church&apos;s rites.
